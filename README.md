# BlackBoxAI Explainers

## What is Explainable AI (XAI)?

Explainable AI (XAI) refers to techniques and methods used to make artificial intelligence (AI) systems transparent and understandable to humans. It aims to shed light on the decision-making processes of AI models, particularly those considered as black boxes, by providing insights into how they arrive at their conclusions.

## Why do we need Explainable AI?

In today's increasingly AI-driven world, the decisions made by AI systems can have profound impacts on individuals and society. Understanding how these decisions are made is crucial for ensuring accountability, trustworthiness, and fairness in AI applications. Explainable AI helps address concerns related to bias, discrimination, and lack of transparency by enabling humans to comprehend and validate AI outputs.
